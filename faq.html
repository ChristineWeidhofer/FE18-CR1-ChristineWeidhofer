      <h2>Do I have to be vegetarian to enjoy the recipes?</h2>
      <p class="text">Nope! My meat-eating husband Jack is my #1 taste tester, and he gives each recipe his stamp of approval before I share it. In addition, many of my friends, family, and recipe testers are not vegetarian, and they all try these recipes. Everything you see here is 100% omnivore-approved! When you’re cooking with good-quality seasonal ingredients, the results are going to taste great, whether you’re vegetarian or not.</p>
      <h2>There are so many recipes on your site! Where do I start?</h2>
      <p class="text">First, sign up for our email list. Our newest recipes (and no spam!) will go straight to your inbox, and you’ll also get a free e-book of 10 of our fan favorites. Otherwise, start by checking out our favorite dinner recipes, breakfast ideas, salads, and soups!</p>
      <h2>What if I’m vegan or gluten-free?</h2>
      <p class="text">Many of our recipes are vegan, gluten-free, or both, and if they’re not, we often offer vegan or gluten-free variations. Get started with these 85+ Vegan Dinner Recipes and 30 Vegan Desserts. You’ll find lots of gluten-free options there as well!</p>
      <h2>Do you have a cookbook?</h2>
      <p class="text">I have two – "<span class="heading">Food Blog</span> Every Day" and "The <span class="heading">Food Blog</span> Cookbook". Both are vegetarian. The main difference between the two is that The Love and Lemons Cookbook is organized by vegetable, A to Z, while Love and Lemons Every Day is organized by meal type – breakfast, dinner, dessert, etc.</p>
